  <h1>Child Safety Standards â€” [Kutch Prajapati Samaj]</h1>
  <p>
    We are committed to protecting children from sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE). 
    Our app strictly prohibits any content, behavior, or activity that promotes or 
    facilitates child exploitation in any form.

  <h2>Our Standards</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No content that depicts, promotes, or encourages child sexual abuse or exploitation is permitted.</li>
    <li>All accounts involved in such activity will be permanently banned.</li>
    <li>We cooperate with law enforcement authorities and will report illegal activity where required.</li>
    <li>We provide users with in-app reporting features to quickly flag inappropriate content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Reporting CSAE</h2>

    If you encounter any content or user violating our standards, please report it immediately using our in-app report feature
